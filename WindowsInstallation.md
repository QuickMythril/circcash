The Windows executable for Circcash has been created but this executable has not been publicly posted. To request the executable file, please send a message to  
circcash9192020@protonmail.com and tell me your reasons for wanting to use Circcash. Since Circcash has not yet been signed, your Antivirus software may label Circcash as a  
'virus' and quarantine Circcash (you should be able to restore Circcash after it has been quarantined), so we recommend for you to use Ubuntu to mine and use Circcash 
instead of Windows at the moment.

Update 10/1/2020: This service is temporarily unavailable. Google Drive does not allow people to share this file, and the core development is unwilling to use any 
paid services to share this file without sufficient sponsorship. The core development will not simply do everything for free.

Update 10/2/2020: When I have tried to share this file on Google Drive, a spiteful and libelous entity has falsely flagged this file for abuse. This only means that I should
not reveal the Circcash Windows executable to anyone for the time being.

Update 11/22/2020: Some have claimed that there is a community developed Circcash wallet for Windows available. Circcash core development does not endorse this wallet nor will Circcash attempt to hinder anyone from using such a wallet.
Furthermore, since the changes made to this wallet are not open source, Circcash core development cannot recommend the use of this wallet.

Update 11/23/2020: At least one entity who has claimed to have created a Circcash wallet for Windows has been repeatedly hostile since 11/22/2020. Please make sure you know the
actual identity of anyone creating a Windows Circcash wallet and please make sure that the wallet is OPEN SOURCE.

Update 1/4/2021: The Windows Circcash wallet will now be made available for the time being in order to help determine why anti-virus programs label this software as malware.

Edited: The Windows Circcash wallet can be found at circcash-0.8.7.5-win32-setup.exe.
